Here are the files for my final project. 

Pitches.ipynb contains exploratory analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, and modelling.
Scrape3.ipynb contains live predictions using the models created in Pitches.ipynb.

The pitches and atbat csvs could not be uploaded due to size. They are available on Kaggle at the link posted at the top of pitches.ipynb.
